# NOTES 
Server packages : 
- axios 
- cors (this isn't really used, it was just to side step a previous problem)
- path 
- dotenv (For api key and port)
Client packages (installed using CDN) :
- ElementPlus for components 
- Google Maps API 
- axios 
- Font Awesome Icons (for the weather icons)
- JSScript for importing Google Maps 

Please install using 'npm install' before launching and that the .env file is present.
If there are problems with running the program please contact me, as I am more than willing to help.

Thank you.
